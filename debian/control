Description: Boot blocks for EMILE, the Early Mac Image LoadEr
 EMILE provides a way to natively boot Macintosh computers who normally
 require Penguin to boot.

 It is however still in an unfinished state; users unfamiliar with Linux
 should note that Penguin currently is a more safe option.

 This package contains the boot blocks which are written to disk by
 EMILE; to install and manage the boot blocks, please install the emile
 package.
